# vRealize Orchestrator Encryption Plugin

## Overview
An inventory-less vRealize Orchestrator (vRO) plugin to provide Encoding, Digest, Cipher, and RSA Encryption.

When an integration or automation project with vRO needed some encryption, developers typically used either CryptoJS or JSEncrypt on top of the Rhino Javascript runtime of Orchestrator.

This plugin provides similar methods, is compatible with binary data and is exponentially more efficient with CPU time.
